          <p><b>The earliest thing that was arguably a computer, was the Telex messaging system made in Germany during the 1930s could send and receive messages via a modified telephone cable. Though, Germany had not yet started WW2, so many countries still used the system without fear of interception by code crackers. For some reason though, post-WW2, many countries returned to using Telex until the early 2000s when for many, they finally felt it had become obsolete. Telex used many teleprinters to type or receive incoming messages. Due to the telegraph cables stretching across multiple countries or across the Atlantic ocean, the messages could take hours or days to even send if the recipient is long distance or across borders. One year afterward, a Belgian created a more sophisticated machine that is more in common with the mainframes of the 80s, the purpose was for it to collect, organize, store, and share information to the world. The machine was called a world brain, and utilized cards for storing written information, records for sound information, and could even use those same records for video information. This was quite a technological marvel for the world of 1930.</b></p>

      <div>      <p>After the 30s, early 40s passed, we moved on from pseudo-computers and started to use vacuum tubes for data transmission, and we also started using the first mainframes and computers with metal inside so that electricity could be more easily transferred. These computers were used during WW2 for the Allied war effort to break the Lorenz code. Just as a quantum computer can do equations in a day that would take a binary computer years, the mainframes could break the Lorenz code in a few hours, contrasted to an experienced code cracker who would take weeks. These computers were very powerful for their time, and are estimated to have shortened the war due to the very fast cracking time that they have. In 1945, Advanced Mathematician John Von Neumann wrote a paper that teased the theory of a fully electronic computer that didn’t use any vacuum tubes, punch cards, or punch boards; the computer would also have the ability to store and retrieve information from written binary digits and code.

      </div>      <p><i>Just as Neumann predicted, fully electronic computers have become a reality, and they have advanced to the point of near perfect simulation of light, ray tracing, shadows, reflections, and physics. They weren’t always so powerful though, with the first fully electronic computer being invented in the 50s and only being sold to governments, universities, or militaries; the computing power was abysmal by today’s standards, with the first storage device only holding 1 megabyte and only having 16bytes of RAM. As computers became more powerful, each upgrade was an exponential upgrade from the last. With computers coming out in the 60s having 1 kilobyte of RAM, it upgraded to 4k in 1976, then the average was 16k in 1980, going to 64k in 84, then upgrading to 512k, to a Megabyte, until in 2000, the average amount of ram was more than 2GBs of RAM, this posed a limit to the computers, as most were 32bit and can only read 2.5GBs of RAM. Whenever Operating System developers released separate versions that allowed for 64bit instructions, they could read up to 512GBs. The average amount of RAM is now 16GBs, so we are fast approaching a need for 96bit or even 128bit Operating Systems.</i></p>
